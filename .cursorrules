# Cursor Rules
# This file contains rules for the Cursor AI assistant.

# Project Context
# - The project uses CMake for build configuration.
# - The project uses C++20 standard.
# - The build directory is `_build`.

# Coding Style
# - Use C++ for backend/native code.

# Documentation
# - Add comments for complex logic.

# Directory Structure
# - Place third-party configuration in `thirdparty/` (FetchContent fetches imgui, sdl3 into _build/_deps).
# - Place project source code in:
#   - `src/apps/` for applications.
#   - `src/libs/` for shared libraries.
#   - `src/tests/` for tests (enable_testing + add_subdirectory in root CMakeLists).

# Build Instructions
# - Use `build_vs.bat` to generate and build the project for Visual Studio.
# - CMake build output goes to `_build/`.
# - Executables are located in `_build/bin/Debug/` (or Release).
# - Third-party libraries (like ImGui) are linked as static libraries.

# Dependencies
# - Third-party libs (imgui, sdl3) are not in the repo; they are fetched via FetchContent
#   into `_build/_deps/` and built from `thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt`.
# - ImGui: ocornut/imgui (branch docking), SDL3: libsdl-org/SDL (release tag); both linked statically.
